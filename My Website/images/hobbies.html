        <h2>Background</h2>
        <p><strong>Hello, I'm Viviane</strong> and I was born in São Paulo (Brazil). I´ve lived in Campinas since my studies at Campinas 
          University, and after my degree, I started to work with Distributed Control System. I love science, traveling and meeting
          people.</p>
        <p>I have traveled to different countries on my vacation, experiencing new habits, customs, food, activities and landscapes. 
          I visited Canada for the first time in 2016 and I fell in love with its multicultural and bilingual society, which 
          I had never seen in another country. So, I decided to move to Vancouver due to the climate, hospitality and vibrant atmosphere,
          to study.</p>
          <p>This will be my new journey, my new <i>home</i> !</p>

        <h2>Goals</h2>
        <p>I decided to study in Vancouver due to more opportunities in computer science area and excellent curriculum of 
          the courses offered. In addition to improving my second language and my curriculum.</p>
        <p>Living abroad, it will add an improvement in my ability to work and live in a multicultural team, expanding my knowledge and  
          concepts, in a harmonious and beneficial way. A great leap in my academic and personal training.</p>
